    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Inspired by The Mastercard (a frozen strawberry-mango concoction that is served on Royal CaribbeanÂ® cruise
        ships), this ice cream transports you immediately to the tropics, with a surprise of fresh spearmint!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh spearmint</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut extract</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh strawberries, pureed</li>
        <li>1 medium mango, pureed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour half-and-half into a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Add sugar and stir until dissolved.
            Continue to heat until half-and-half is hot, but do not let it come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks in a small bowl until pale yellow.</li>
        <li>Slowly add about 1 cup of the half-and-half mixture to the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Repeat with
            another cup. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half mixture and cook
            over medium heat until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Do not let the mixture boil.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in spearmint and coconut extract. Pour mixture into a bowl with a pour spout and
            let cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn to the consistency of soft-serve. Add strawberry
            puree. Continue to churn until ice cream has thickened. Transfer ice cream to a bowl and clean out the ice
            cream maker with a rubber spatula. Place strawberry ice cream in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining ice cream base into the ice cream maker and churn to the consistency of soft-serve. Add
            mango puree. Continue to churn until the ice cream has thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove strawberry ice cream from the freezer. Place a large scoop of strawberry ice cream in a 9-inch loaf
            pan using 2 large spoons. Top with a large scoop of mango ice cream. Fill up the loaf pan, continuing to
            alternate flavors. Cover with plastic wrap and place into the freezer for a minimum of 4 hours.</li>
